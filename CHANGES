    2012-07-28                                                      SLOC  497
        * cleanup prior to moving dev to PA
v0.2.0
    2012-07-07
        * Installed Ubuntu pycrypto package on LA.  This didn't have 
            Crypto.Signaure so I installed from source, pycrypto-2.6.tar.gz
            from dlitz.net
            - googling finds articles that claim that pycrypto is largely
                implemented in python and so somewhat slow
            - but note that pycrypto includes a good chunk of libtom
            - also, PKCS1_v1.5 is to be found in Signature

v0.1.2
    2012-06-14
        * logging works, at least to the access log

v0.1
    2012-06-04
        * this pzog (0.1) is single-threaded except that it makes use
            of serverutil for logging
        * all acceptable messages are CR-LF terminated
            - these two bytes are removed before writing to the log
        * this pzog has no more than one connection open at any time
        * 'shutdown\r\n' shuts down the server as well as closing the
            connection
            - shutdown must be called in a finally block and it must
                close the log files

    2012-06-03
        * create logs/ if not present
        * set up logging to access.log
            - and error.log                                          XXX FAILED
        * daemon listens on 55551 = PZOG_PORT
        * accepts connections from anywhere
        * accepts messages of length <= PZOG_MAX_MSG = 512 bytes
            - this includes terminating CR-LF but does not allow for any
                terminating null byte
        * acceptable messages are logged to logs/access.log with a
            timestamp
            - 'quit' + CRLF is an acceptable message and closes the
                connection
            - the connection remains open after receiving any other
                acceptable message
            - 'keepalive' + CRLF is an acceptable message
                * and may cause some special action
        * bad messages are logged to logs/error.log with a timestamp
            and ipAddr:port of sender
            - bad messages cause the connection to be closed            * ???
        * a keyboard interrupt (ctrl-C) causes pzogd to shut down
            in an orderly fashion
